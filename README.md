# Nike Home page Clone

This project is clone of nike home page which is built in React.js and some bootstrap with fontawsome icon.
This porject is has multiple components which is buit to ease my work and structure my app.

In app.js the routing of paths is there as i am created home page so only route is available i.e the Home.js where all the components are lined up , there are so many button available to the nike main page, i placed the div instead of that button as it is clone, and one can easily repalce div with buttons to add functionality and navigation.
